# Your typical programmer `Hello World`

| I have been thinking for a good while to blog post. With the current creative-content climate, AI & all the limiting-beliefs one could think of. I am taking the plunge.

## It's me

| In case it is the first time we `meet` or it's been a while since we had a chat

I am currently a Software Engineer, worked for more than 5 years in the Software Industry, aka. programming for different contracts / projects / own side-projects. However, as you might know I've started my career around when I was 17, in Romania for a Web & Graphic Design company. A team of fantastic 3 designers, all which started from no-certification, unrelated University to their Design career & they are brilliant people.

But it is not all about career, my spare-time was always filled with something else, be it competitive Ballroom Dancing, longboarding, I guess I like learning & doing cool stuff with awesome people.

Few years later, now, I am in the UK figuring out how to run companies, do business that helps communities & people... and becoming a better person each day.

### _So, here are some things that I am crazy about:_

1. bringing my ideas to life
2. helping people - `i know clicheic, right`
3. overcoming limiting beliefs in self & others
4. reaching higher states of being, naturally
5. teaching people, what I know (so far overcoming mental states & limitations, Web Development & sometimes dancing)
6. sharing hopefully love, forgiveness & mindfulness
7. exploring productivity with mindfulness - how do we get through the noise of `overachieving` and `try-hard` gurus while being successful, especially pressure from others

## Here's what you'll see in this post

| as said this is more about what kind of content I will be bringing to the `www` world.

1. What I have been up to lately
2. What I will be doing with this blog / what is this about
3. Becoming iteratively creative

### What I have been up to lately

So you might have followed a bit my social media footprint, potentially saw my trails & trials.

1. I am running a Blog, this right here right now üñäÔ∏è
2. Soon to be Entrepreneur, through OneDay - for my soon-to-be start up üöÄ
3. I am also running a mindfulness TikTok & Instagram through my project: Mindful Youth Mentoring üßò‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
4. With a friend we are running a Mindful Coffee Exploration Project: Beange ‚òï
5. Got NLP Certified hoping to help as many people as possible to let go / forgive: themselves, situations & people that impact them in ways that do not help them grow üß†
6. Property, learning & helping others learn about property investments üèòÔ∏è
